These are some Microsoft office UI files which add useful functions to the HOME ribbon, essentially getting rid of the need to use the FILE backstage, which can be distracting. They were created with Office 2013 professional.

Installation
============

Copy the .officeUI files to %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\ - typically something like C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office
